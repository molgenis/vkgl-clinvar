##Report of ClinVar's processing of your recent submission
##Explanation of the columns in this report
#Your_variant_id:          the identifier you may have submitted for the reported allele
#VariantID:                the identifier assigned by ClinVar and used to build the URL, namely https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/VariantID
#AlleleID:                 the list of of identifiers assigned by ClinVar to each simple allele generated from your submission
#Your_record_id:           the identifier you may have submitted for the reported allele-disorder combination
#SCV:                      the accession assigned by ClinVar to your submitted interpretation of the Variation-Condition relationship
#RCV:                      the accession assigned by ClinVar to the aggregation of your submission with other submissions of an interpretation of the same Variation-Condition relationship
#Your_variant_description  a concatenated list of the definitions you supplied of each allele in this record. This may include both HGVS expressions and a SequenceLocation report.
#Preferred_variant_name    the name ClinVar calculates for the VariantiD
#Your condition name       the name you submitted for the condition you interpreted
#Your condition identifier the identifer you submitted for the condition you intepreted
#ClinVar_condition_name    the preferred condition name in ClinVar
#Assigned_Concept_ID       the MedGen concept id for the preferred condition name in ClinVar (may be null)
#Clinical_significance     your interpretation of the variation-condition relationship
#Date_last_evaluated       your report of the last date you evaluated the variation-condition relationship
#Assertion_criteria        the name of the assertion criterion you supplied
#Submission_date           the date of your latest submission
#Novelty                   the contribution your initial submission made relative to other records in ClinVar
#Status                    the status of the SCV being reported. A comprehensive report, including status other than current, is provided only on request
#Info                      an optional set of warning about this record relative to other data at NCBI
#Invalid                   a warning that NCBI was not able to process your variant description as supplied
